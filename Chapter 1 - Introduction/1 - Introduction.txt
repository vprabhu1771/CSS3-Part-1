CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets." It is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation and formatting of a document written in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language). CSS is used to define the visual appearance of web pages, including aspects like layout, colors, fonts, and spacing. By separating the content (HTML) from its presentation (CSS), web developers can create more flexible and consistent designs across their websites.
